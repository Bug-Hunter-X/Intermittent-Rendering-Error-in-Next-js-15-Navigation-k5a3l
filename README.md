# Intermittent Rendering Error in Next.js 15 Navigation

This repository demonstrates a bug in a Next.js 15 application where navigation to a specific page sometimes fails, resulting in a blank page or an error.  The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description

A Next.js application with basic navigation between two pages ('Home' and 'About') exhibits intermittent rendering issues.  The 'About' page may fail to load completely, showing a blank screen or an error message, despite no apparent changes in code or deployment.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the '/about' page.
5. Repeat step 4 multiple times; you will notice that in some occasions the page will not render properly.

## Potential Causes

Possible causes include:

* **Caching issues:**  Aggressive caching mechanisms might interfere with the rendering process.  Testing with different browsers and clearing caches can aid in reproduction.
* **Race conditions:**  Asynchronous operations in the component might lead to race conditions that manifest intermittently.
* **Server-side issues:**  Intermittent issues with the development server or deployment infrastructure could cause the problem.

## Solution

A possible solution might involve adding more robust error handling and logging to pin down the exact source of the problem.
